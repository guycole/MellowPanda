//INTRODUCTION//

Mellow Panda is a collection of applications which enable remote control of 
communications and “scanner” radios via RS-232/USB interfaces.

I created Mellow Panda because most radio manufacturers only support “Brand W” 
computer operating systems, and I use LINUX (Ubuntu LINUX to be specific). 
There are already many similar LINUX based applications available, but they 
did not fit my needs (although they were helpful to review).  Mellow Panda was 
developed on Ubuntu 8.10 desktop and (to date) has been tested w/Ubuntu 8.04.3 
desktop, Ubuntu 9.04 server and Fedora 11.

Mellow Panda takes a different approach from most (all?) other scanner 
control applications in that it is not a single monolithic application.
Rather, Mellow Panda is a collection of specialized applications.

The deployment model for Mellow Panda consists of a server (pandad) and 
various clients.  I supply a command line client (panda) and several
demonstration scripts.  (It turns out that most of my needs are satisfied
by using scripts).

panda/pandad employs a simple protocol which should make it simple for you
to create your own client.

pandad does does not interpret the scanner commands, there are not generic
radio commands such as "tune".  All of the radio specific logic resides
within the client applications.

Be sure to check the doc subdirectory for a more details.

//DOWNLOADING//

This project is hosted on SourceForge at http://mellowpanda.sourceforge.net/

//UNPACK//

tar -xvzf mellow-panda-1.0.0.tar.gz 

//COMPILE AND INSTALL//

make;make install

make install distributes this files
  /usr/local/bin/panda       (panda executable)
  /usr/local/sbin/pandad     (pandad executable)
  /usr/local/etc/pandad.conf (pandad configuration)

Update your configuration at /usr/local/etc/pandad.conf (see docs directory) 

Optional:
  pandad start/stop script in dist directory, copy to /etc/init.d/pandad  
  Update your /etc/syslog.conf to support "local5"

//TEST//

It is always fun to get a new device working w/RS-232. 

pandad has command line options to help you work through this.

See the doc directory for some suggestions.

//RUNNING//

Once you have pandad and the radios happily communicating, you can place it
in the background and forget it.

There are sample scripts provided w/the distribution to illustrate the use
of panda/pandad.

I have java clients (a swing client and a servlet) on the way, but they
will be a separate download (still part of mellow panda, but a different
tar file).  RSN.  Really.
